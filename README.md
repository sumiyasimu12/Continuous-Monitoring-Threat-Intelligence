# Continuous Monitoring and Threat Intelligence

## Project Overview

**Continuous Monitoring and Threat Intelligence** is a Python-based tool designed to enhance cybersecurity by continuously monitoring systems for anomalous behavior. By integrating with threat intelligence feeds, the tool can identify potential security incidents and generate alerts. This project aims to provide organizations with a foundational monitoring solution that helps mitigate risks and respond to threats proactively.

## Features

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Periodically checks for anomalies in the system to ensure ongoing security.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Fetches real-time threat data from a specified feed, providing context for security assessments.
- **Alert Generation**: Sends notifications when suspicious activities are detected, enabling timely responses.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- **Requests Library**: This can be installed via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumiyasimu12/continuous-monitoring-threat-intelligence.git
   cd continuous-monitoring-threat-intelligence
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Configure the Threat Feed URL**:

   Update the `THREAT_FEED_URL` variable in the code to point to your actual threat intelligence feed:

   ```python
   THREAT_FEED_URL = "https://example.com/threat-feed"  # Update with actual threat feed URL
   ```

## Usage

To start monitoring your system, run the script:

```bash
python monitor.py
```

### How It Works

1. The tool fetches threat data from the specified feed at regular intervals.
2. It simulates monitoring for anomalies within the system.
3. If an anomaly is detected, the tool triggers an alert, notifying users of a potential security incident.
